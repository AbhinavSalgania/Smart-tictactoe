# Smart Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that allows you to play against another player or against the computer. The game is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is hosted using Github pages.

## Gameplay

When you first load the game, you will be presented with two options: play against player or play against computer. 

#### Play against player

If you choose to play against another player, you can choose to enter the names of players. The game board appears, and you can take turns making your moves. The game will end when one player wins or when the game is a draw.

#### Play against computer

If you choose to play against the computer, you can use any of the two options: easy peasy and impossible.

- **Easy Peasy:** You go first and the computer randomly selects a box.
- **Impossible:** The computer will use the minimax algorithm to make its move. This mode is meant to be challenging and will be difficult to beat.

### Back button

There is also a back button that allows you to go back to the home page if the game has not started yet. If the game has already started, the back button will prompt you to refresh the page to go back to the home page.

### Reset button

This enables the user to reset a game when a game ends without reloading the page. It works perfectly in Player vs Player and Easy Peasy game options.
