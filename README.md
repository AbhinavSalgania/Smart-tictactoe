# Smart Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The game allows for three different modes: player vs player, player vs random computer, and player vs AI computer. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move.
Getting Started

To start playing the game, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. You can then select which game mode you would like to play from the main menu.
Prerequisites

    A web browser
    Internet connection (for loading the AI model)

Gameplay

The game is played on a 3x3 board, with each space on the board represented by a button. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the board until a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until the board is full and the game is a draw.

In player vs player mode, players take turns placing their symbol on the board by clicking on the corresponding button. In player vs random computer mode, the player goes first and places their symbol on the board by clicking on the corresponding button. The computer then randomly chooses a space on the board to place its symbol. In player vs AI computer mode, the player goes first and places their symbol on the board by clicking on the corresponding button. The AI then uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the computer and places its symbol on the board.
